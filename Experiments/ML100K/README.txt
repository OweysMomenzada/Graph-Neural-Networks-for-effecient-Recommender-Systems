abstract = {The MovieLens datasets are widely used in education, research, and industry. They
are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each year, reflecting their use in popular
press programming books, traditional and online courses, and software. These datasets
are a product of member activity in the MovieLens movie recommendation system, an
active research platform that has hosted many experiments since its launch in 1997.
This article documents the history of MovieLens and the MovieLens datasets. We include
a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform
from the perspective of a research organization. We document best practices and limitations
of using the MovieLens datasets in new research.},
